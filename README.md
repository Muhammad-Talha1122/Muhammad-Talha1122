Hey there! 👋

I'm Muhammad Talha, a developer who loves turning ideas into real, working projects 💻.

If a cool idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll code it, test it, and get it running 🚀.

My main focus is Python 🐍, but I’m always exploring other languages and tools 🛠️. My favorite tools are VS Code, GitHub, and Figma for planning and designing projects 🎨.

I’ve worked on a bunch of projects — some public, some private — and I’m always building more to learn and improve 💡.

Fun Facts:

I love solving problems and learning new programming tricks 🧠

Turning ideas into working code is my favorite hobby 💻

Hobbies: coding, building cool projects, and exploring new tech.
